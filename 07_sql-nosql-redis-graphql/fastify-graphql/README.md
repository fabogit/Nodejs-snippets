# Exploring GraphQL

GraphQL serves as a query language for APIs and provides a runtime environment for executing
queries. Unlike REST, which relies on rigid endpoint structures, GraphQL allows clients to request
exactly what they need and nothing more, making it efficient for fetching data. This flexibility reduces
the amount of data transferred over the network and allows for more precise and optimized queries.

In projects where your application deals with complex, interrelated data structures, such as social
networks, e-commerce platforms, or **content management systems (CMSs)**, GraphQL’s ability to
query deeply nested data in a single request makes it a perfect match with Node.js. This combination
reduces the need for multiple REST endpoints and minimizes data over-fetching, optimizing both
the network performance and the developer experience.

We will create a simple GraphQL API with a book and author relationship using
Fastify and Mercurius (<http://npmjs.com/package/mercurius>), a GraphQL adapter for
Fastify. This tutorial will guide you through setting up your Node.js project, installing dependencies,
defining your GraphQL schema, implementing resolvers, and running your server. We’ll use a simple
in-memory data structure to simulate a database for authors and books.

Start the Fastify server running `node server.js` and navigate to <http://localhost:3000/graphiql> to access the
GraphiQL interface.

Try crafting some queries in the GraphiQL interface. For example, try executing the following
query to fetch all books with their authors:

```Graphql
query {
  books {
    name
    author   {
    name
    }
  }
}
```

## How it works

We explore the creation of a GraphQL API using Fastify and Mercurius by defining
data models, establishing a GraphQL schema, implementing resolvers for data fetching, and setting
up a Fastify server.

By creating mock data in `data.js`, we simulate a backend data store that contains authors and
books. This approach allows us to focus on the GraphQL setup without the complexity of integrating
an actual database. The data represents a basic relationship between books and their authors, serving
as the foundation for our GraphQL queries.

The GraphQL schema defined in `schema.graphql` acts as a contract between the server and the
client. It specifies the types of queries that can be made, the types of data that can be fetched, and
the relationships between different data types. In our case, the schema outlines how to query books
and authors and indicates that each book is linked to an author and vice versa. This structure allows
clients to understand and predict the shape of the data returned by the API.

The resolvers in `resolvers.js` are functions that handle the logic for fetching the data for each
type specified in the schema. They connect the GraphQL queries to the underlying data, essentially
telling the server where and how to retrieve or modify the data. In the recipe, resolvers fetch books
and authors from the mock data and resolve the relationships between them, such as finding an author
for a book or listing all books written by an author.

Finally, setting up the Fastify server and integrating Mercurius allows us to serve our GraphQL API
over HTTP. The server listens for requests on a specified port and uses the schema and resolvers to
process GraphQL queries.

Upon running the server, you can navigate to the GraphiQL interface to visually construct and execute
queries against your API. This interactive environment is useful for testing and debugging queries.

Whether GraphQL is the appropriate architecture for your project is a vast topic that goes well beyond
the basics covered in this recipe. It involves deep considerations such as optimizing query performance,
ensuring security, efficient data loading to avoid over- or under-fetching, and integrating with different
databases or APIs. While we’ve laid the groundwork with Fastify and Mercurius, diving into these
more complex aspects is essential for developing sophisticated, production-ready GraphQL services.

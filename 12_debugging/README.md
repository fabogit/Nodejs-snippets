# Debugging Node.js

The asynchronous nature of JavaScript and Node.js can make the debugging process non-trivial.
Unlike traditional synchronous code execution, the asynchronous behavior of Node.js introduces
complexities that can challenge even experienced developers. However, over the past decade, Node.js
has matured significantly as a technology. Along with this maturation, the debugging capabilities and
facilities have improved in tandem, providing developers with more robust tools and methodologies
to troubleshoot their applications.

We will explore the various steps we can take to make our applications easier to debug.
By implementing best practices and adopting a structured approach to coding, we can mitigate some
of the inherent difficulties associated with asynchronous programming. We will also delve into the
modern tools available for debugging Node.js applications, such as the built-in debugger, various
third-party debugging tools, and advanced logging techniques.

Additionally, we will cover how to leverage Node.jsâ€™s diagnostic reports feature, a powerful utility
introduced in the latest versions of Node.js. This feature provides in-depth insights into the state
of your application at the time of failure, making it easier to pinpoint the root causes of issues. By
the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the strategies and tools
necessary to effectively debug Node.js applications, ensuring smoother development and more stable
production environments.

Here we will cover the following:

- Diagnosing issues with Chrome DevTools

- Logging with Node.js

- Enabling debug logs

- Enabling Node.js core debug logs

- Increasing stack trace size

- Creating diagnostic reports
